Notes from Sep 30:
Make the CF code clearer on a slide. Brian did a great job with this.
At least the HTTP calls.

Notes from May 18 preso:
Too much material for 45 minutes, I skipped the demos completely.
Move them to past Q/A?
Make a slide talking about them as examples? (I think this is good.)
Add notes to later code demos.

file demo on AI Studio uses Files API - maybe switch to it?

Maybe switch Demos to Examples, make one slide.
Maybe new demos are short but interesting, one idea - given a weather forecast, summarize (ive got this done already)
Given a folder of images, look for (name).txt, and if not there, get description of image, save it
